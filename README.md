## Commit early, commit often

Whenever possible, try to commit your changes as soon as you have a small piece of code working.
We're following [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) in order to standardize our commit messages. We're using [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) with [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) as tools to apply those conventions.

1.  **Commit your changes**

    ```shell
      yarn commit
